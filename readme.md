# Yelpcamp 🏕️

_A Full-Stack CRUD App Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB_

## 📘 Overview

Yelpcamp is a full-stack web application built during my full-stack developer program. It allows users to share and review campground locations around the world — similar to Yelp, but focused on outdoor adventures. The app supports full CRUD functionality, user authentication, authorization, interactive maps, and image uploads.

## 📚 What I Learned

This was one of the first full-stack applications I built during my full-stack web development program. It helped solidify my understanding of:
RESTful API design
Server-side routing and middleware
MongoDB and schema design with Mongoose
User auth with Passport.js
Working with third-party APIs and services
